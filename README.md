# Customer Churn Risk Model

This project demonstrates how structured customer data can be used to estimate churn probability using machine learning techniques.

The objective is not only to predict churn, but to understand which business and behavioral factors contribute most to customer attrition.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a classification model capable of identifying high-risk customers using:

- Contract type
- Internet service type
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Service subscriptions
- Billing characteristics

---

## 🧠 Model

- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Structured feature encoding
- Risk scoring logic
- High-risk classification threshold

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn.
- Fiber optic customers present elevated churn probability.
- Long-term contracts strongly reduce churn risk.
- Tenure is inversely correlated with churn.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
