# Churn Risk Model

A data-driven approach to identifying high-risk customers in a subscription-based telecom environment.

## Objective

Develop an interpretable predictive model to identify customers with high probability of churn and support retention strategies.

## Dataset

- 7,043 customers
- 21 features
- 26% churn rate
- Telecom subscription dataset

## Methodology

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Behavioral risk segmentation
4. Logistic regression with class imbalance handling
5. Model interpretability through coefficient analysis

## Results

- Accuracy: 73%
- Recall (Churn): 79%
- Identified key risk drivers:
  - Month-to-month contracts
  - Fiber optic service
  - Electronic check payment
  - Low tenure

## Business Implications

The model enables prioritization of high-risk customers and supports data-driven retention strategies.

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
